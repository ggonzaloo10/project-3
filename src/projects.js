        analysis: "For this project, I wanted to created something simple and functional, like a one page website. I used a palette with a range of blues, in order to convey freedom, loyalty, harmony, fidelity and truth; qualities I think a profesional profile should convey. Including some yellow creates contrast in case I wanted to highlight an important point. The main idea was to create 4 differents cards (information about myself, skills, tools and contact) represented by 4 icons. This cards would appear as you click on them.",
